# Hi, my name is dickwyn!

I'm a proud Malaysian and Sun Devil. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University with Magna Cum Laude honors. My degree's focus was on human-computer interaction and mobile computing.

As a technology enthusiast, I enjoy exploring new technology products that come out. There's something about new and fresh tech products that excites me.
In my spare time I enjoy blogging, photography, travelling (and some plane spotting) and doing (a lot of) online shopping. Additionally, I am an advocate for sustainability, gender equality and inclusion.
